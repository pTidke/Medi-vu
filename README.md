Medi-vu is a data-driven tool designed to analyze and visualize healthcare accessibility and disease prevalence across California. The project addresses disparities in healthcare access, integrating critical hospital metrics with disease data to identify underserved regions and inform targeted interventions.

---

## Features

- **Healthcare Accessibility Ranking:** Analyzes nurse-to-patient ratios, bed availability, and healthcare professional deficits.
- **Disease Mortality Analysis:** Identifies high-mortality regions for major diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes healthcare and disease trends using geospatial mapping with Tableau.
- **Data Integration:** Combines diverse datasets, including hospital infrastructure, Medi-Cal providers, and mortality rates.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Data Processing:** Python, CSV, and Excel-based cleaning and integration.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Tableau for mapping and visualization.
- **Datasets:** Includes data on hospital metrics, Medi-Cal providers, mortality rates, and population density.

## Key Insights

- Significant disparities in nurse-to-patient ratios and bed availability across regions.
- Overlap between high disease mortality rates and limited healthcare accessibility.
- Urban and coastal areas often have better healthcare infrastructure compared to rural regions.

---

## Recommendations

- Expand healthcare facilities in underserved regions.
- Deploy mobile healthcare units in rural areas.
- Focus on preventive care for high-mortality diseases.
- Use predictive analytics to address future healthcare needs.

---

## Future Development

- Incorporate real-time data for dynamic analysis.
- Enhance geospatial precision with shapefiles and GeoJSON.
- Develop a web-based interactive dashboard.
